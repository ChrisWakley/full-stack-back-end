# full-stack-back-end

This Project links with my other repo "full-stack-front-end" to create a full stack project.
The whole project links together to present an Single Page Application, a web based database that gives you a full breakdown of weaponry and armour statistics 
for the online game: Runescape 3.

This particular part of the project contains my API written in Java.

It contains commands to Call, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) data objects from the central database which is held as a table on mySQL.

I utilised Postman to test the functions/methods as i wrote them and the API itself was written using SpringBoot to make threading it all together easy and neat.
